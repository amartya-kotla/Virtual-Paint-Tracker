# Virtual-Paint-Tracker
Built a live virtual paint machine using OpenCV by detecting the color of the object and tracking its motion to create a trail of paint using Contour Manipulation and HSV - mask manipulation.


#Note

The values and preprocessing used in the virt_paint.py were used based on the image quality of the webcam I used for this project as well as the location and lighting which affected the overall image. Please keep this in mind should you choose to make a similar project of your own.
